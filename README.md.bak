### Project Title
Exploration of Bike Share Data Using R

### Description
This project is an analysis of bikeshare data from Washington, Chicago, and New York peformed in an R Kupter notebook. It is within the scope of Udacity's Programming for Data Science with R nanodegree course. Three questions are explored:

1. What is the most common month for travel across all cities?
2. What is the most common end station in each city?
3. How do the trip durations compare between the New York and Chicago, as well as by genders?

### Files used
The following files are part of this project:

1. README.md: this files
2. Explore_bikeshare_data.ipynb: the Jupyter R notebook with the analysis
3. Explore_bikeshare_data.html: the Jupyter R notebook exported in HTML format

To run the notebook, CSV files with the bike share data are needed: chicago.csv for Chicago, washington.csv for Washington, and newyork_city.csv for Chicago.

### Credits
The Jupyter R notebook is based on a short starter code with instructions and data file import provided by Udacity. This GitHub repository was forked from [https://github.com/udacity/pdsnd_github](https://github.com/udacity/pdsnd_github), and the project files were added to the fork.
